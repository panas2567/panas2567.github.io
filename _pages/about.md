My name is Ondřej Pánek, and I'm a data engineer from the Czech republic. 

My alma mater is at [CTU, FNSPE in Prague](https://fjfi.cvut.cz/en/), 
where I finished my master's degree in the field of software engineering.
After the studies, I've started working as a data engineer in a Prague's company
[BigHub](https://www.bighub.ai/), where I was lucky enough to have the opportunity
to work on various fast-paced projects on the technological edge of the data engineering, 
cloud computing, and machine learning fields.

Beside the tech world, I'm a proud member of my local ice-hockey team [HC SDH Lhotka Flames](https://www.instagram.com/sdhlhotkaflames/)!
