- base64 encoding
- pangeo mind map (how the different tools relate together)

# utf8-exploration
- Add sketches
    - ASCII as a bus of 128 characters
    - Sequence of bytes where the computer is worried how to read it because it doesn't know the encoding
    - UTF-8 being upset about UTF-16 because it's not used, and it limits the number of characters for UTF-8
- What is the self synchronization?
- Create small clickable icons for references instead of numbers?
