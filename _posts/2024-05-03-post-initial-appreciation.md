The initial post of this personal website cannot be anything else but an appreciation of **Michael Rose**, the author
of the amazing Jekyll theme called [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes){:target="_blank"}, 
which was exactly the theme used for this site.

It's totally worth it to check Michael's personal website [Made Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/){:target="_blank"}, 
where one can find many interesting articles not only about web.

For anyone interested in creating his/her own website using MM theme hosted on GitHub Pages, checkout the
[starter project](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter){:target="_blank"}. It's almost unbelievable how easy
it is to bring a wonderful personal site to life in literally minutes.

Checkout the [Quick-Start Guide](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/){:target="_blank"} of 
the Minimal Mistakes, where you can [Buy Michael A Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/mmistakes){:target="_blank"} if you like.
I'll definitely do so!
