Is anybody reading this? I mean, except of me and some random web crawling bots. Anyway, it doesn't matter
too much. So, just in case someone would actually find this, or at least my future me, I'll leave some more
or less meaningless lines here.

How would I like to use this space? As a personal website of course. Right, but why? 
Because I find myself occasionally in a situation like I would love to write all this (and that) to couple of lines.  
What exactly? Yes, sure, I know myself (at least to some extent I guess), hence I did not introduce myself.

I'm a data engineer and a tech enthusiast. That's it, easy. Well, that's the subject I'd like to be
moving around the most here. Naturally, some exceptions might be made.

The first purpose to store a content here is mainly for my own use, to jot something down, so I do not forget. 
To collect some interesting ideas or concepts that I've learnt. To capture things I find too interesting not to be
elaborated about here. In case at least one person finds any of the posts useful maybe some when in 
the future, I'll consider the second purpose complete.

I'd really love to have at least one meaningful post here until the end of the year 2024. Let's see how it
goes!
