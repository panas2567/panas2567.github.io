I'm picking up 5 Python built-ins, and I'll invest few minutes per day per each of them. As a starter, the built-ins
chosen are the ones I use the most on a daily basis. Am I going to find out the potential usage of these 
I had no idea about? 

_Note: This is the index for the separate sub-parts. I found it a bit more uncluttered versus having the whole content 
on a single page._

The goal of these small posts is not to go to the very detail, but rather uncover the functionality that's 
not that regularly used (understand - by me :wink:).

# [Day 1 - `print()`]({% post_url 2025-10-12-5dayswith-python-builtins-print %})

- `sep` &#8594; Separator
- `end` &#8594; Ending character
- `flush` &#8594; Flush buffer
- `file` &#8594; Output file

# Day 2 - `len()` (coming soon)

# Day 3 - `open()` (coming soon)

# Day 4 - `dict()` (coming soon)

# Day 5 - `dir()` (coming soon)
